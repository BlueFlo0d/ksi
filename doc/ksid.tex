\title{The \Ksi Audio Engine}

\maketitle
\chapter{System Overview}
The \Ksi audio engine is a parallel DSP execution engine which supports real-time editing of signal processing graph. The system is consisted of a scheduler, signal mixing facilities, real-time editing routines, DSP node components and a JIT recompilation module \todo.
\section{Scheduler}
\section{Real-time Editing Support}
The \Ksi audio engine utilizes a real-time signal processing graph updating scheme which is wait-free from the real-time threads' side.\par
Aside from audio worker threads and the audio $master$ thread, two additional thread is involved in signal processing graph editing process. One is the \emph{editor} thread which responds to audio editing commands called by other modules or sent by client. The other is the \emph{committer} thread which maintains the integrity of the concurrent data structures.\par
Two copies of the same signal processing graph is maintained to support real-time updating, labelled with epoch 0 and epoch 1. This two copies have some references to shared buffers in order to make it transparent to stateful DSP components when switching between the two copies. A queue \emph{allocBufs} is used to synchronize those references. Another queue $cmds$ is used to synchronize the two signal processing graphs. The engine also keep two variables \emph{epoch} and \emph{audioEpoch} which take values in $\{0,1\}$, and the audio workers always use the signal processing graph labelled with epoch \emph{audioEpoch} to perform signal processing. At the beginning, the two signal processing graphs are empty and $epoch=audioEpoch=0$. When some editing commands are sent to the engine, the steps below is followed to perform those editing commands and keep the integrity of the two copies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{editor} thread perform the editing command sequence on the signal processing graph labelled with $(epoch+1)(\mod 2)$ and enqueue each command into $cmds$ in order. If some allocation request of shared buffer occurs, it allocates the memory and enqueued the reference of the allocated memory into \emph{allocBufs}. If some deallocation request of shared buffer occurs, it can either ignore it or enqueue it to another queue $deallocCheck$ for integrity check in development environment.
\item The \emph{editor} thread issues a commit. This means it update \emph{epoch} to $(epoch+1)(\mod 2)$ and notifies the \emph{committor} thread to start the synchronizing process. After this, the $editor$ thread is permitted to do other useful jobs and responds to client requests. However, it cannot perform any new editing command before the $committor$ notifies it the commit is completed.
\item When $master$ start processing a new buffer, it updates $audioEpoch$ to $epoch$ and assign the workers to perform calculation using the signal processing graph labelled with epoch \emph{audioEpoch}.
\item $committor$ waits for the condition $epoch == audioEpoch$ (this is implemented using a semaphore to avoid busy waiting). It then dequeues from $cmds$ to perform the same editing sequence on the signal processing graph labelled with $(epoch+1)(\mod 2)$. If some allocation of shared buffer occurs, it dequeues a reference from $allocBufs$ and provide this reference. If some deallocation request of shared buffer occurs, it deallocates the memory. If $deallocCheck$ is maintained, it dequeues a reference from $deallocCheck$ and issue an assertion failure if the reference does not equal to the reference which is requested to be deallocated.
\item $committor$ notifies $editor$ that the commit is completed.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{The \Ksi Audio Daemon}
\section{Overview}
The \Ksi audio daemon is a service that runs a \Ksi audio engine instance, processes editing commands sent from clients and handles signal I/O with clients or audio drivers. A \Ksi audio daemon process hosts multiple \todo signal processing graphs for multiple clients on a single audio worker thread pool to reduce scheduling overhead and thus enhance performace. The control messages between clients and the daemon are sent on named pipes. Clients may also request shared memory based IPC channels \todo for sending or receiving signals and events from the daemon.
\section{Control Interface}
\subsection{Channel Establishing}
When started, the \Ksi audio daemon process opens a named pipe $p_{\texttt{listen}}$ at the path spercified in \lstinline{~/.ksidrc} and open it with read access. If not spercified, the default path \lstinline{/var/run/ksid_listen} is used.\par
When a client want to establish a control channel with the \Ksi audio daemon, it firsts create two named pipes $p_{\texttt{control}}$ (which the \Ksi audio daemon should have read access to) and $p_{\texttt{return}}$ (which the \Ksi audio daemon should have read access to). It then tries to obtain an exclusive file lock of $p_{\texttt{listen}}$. After obtaining the value, it writes the path of $p_{\texttt{control}}$, a new line character, the path of $p_{\texttt{return}}$ and a new line character in order. It then first tries to open $p_{\texttt{control}}$ with write access and then tries to open $p_{\texttt{return}}$ with read access. After all the operations above are performed successfully, a control channel between the client and the \Ksi audio daemon process is established. The client is assigned an uninitialized signal processing graph. The client can then send control commands via writing command followed by a new line character to $p_{\texttt{control}}$, and the \Ksi audio daemon will write the return message for each command to $p_{\texttt{return}}$ in order.
\subsection{Error Codes}
Every commands of the \Ksi audio daemon will return an error code as the beginning of the response. The error codes are listed in Figure \ref{fig:errcode}.\par

Any commands that refer to a node will generate error 1, 2 or 3 if such node does not exist. Any commands that refer to a port will generate error 5, 6 or 7 if such port does not exist. Any commands that refer to a time sequence resource will generate error 4 if such time sequence resource does not exist. Other command-spercified cases is described in Section \ref{sec:rpc}.
